				<p class="grid_8 alpha">
					Hello! My name is Danielle Roth, I'm a design student out of Cheney, Washington. I am passionate about design, people, and nature. I am currently studying to receive my Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Visual Communications Design at Eastern Washington University. I enjoy volunteering, working with my local church, and spending as much time as I can with my husband of two years, David.

			<h3 class="header"> Volunteer Experience </h3>
				<p class="grid_8 alpha">
					I have acted as a volunteer youth counselor for the previous 2 years through the AWANA program. This has given me wonderful opportunities to develop as a leader and mentor. I have also functioned as a volunteer coordinator of the worship support team and provider of technical support for regular Sunday services at my church, Cheney Community Church, for the past two years. This time has grown me in developing communication, time management, and organizational skills, as well as helping me to become a good team player.</p>
			
			<h4 class="header"> Professional Experience </h4>
				<p class="grid_12 omega">
					As of May 2014, I have had the privilege to be employed at the Eastern Washington University's Running Start Office as an Office Aide. This position allows me to interact on a daily basis with young people who are achieving college credits while finishing high school. I regularly design Running Start promotional material, organize and create Excel spreadsheets, manage and process paperwork, direct all front desk phone traffic, and schedule appointments for the advisors. This work has helped me to be well developed in organization and taking direction.

			<h5 class="header"> Design Work Portfolio </h5>
				<p>
					As a design student in the BFA of Visual Communications Design at EWU, it has been my great enjoyment to create visual works to satisfy design problems. I have had to solve design queries in many different forms, and I invite you to take a look at a sample of my work.</p>

			<h6 class="header"> Personal Craftsmanship</h6>
				<p>
					The main reason I chose to pursue design was because I have had a lifelong strong passion for creating. I have enjoyed through my life developing skills in crafting through leather, wood, crochet work, drawing, ceramic, and photography. The wonderful thing about creativity is its many expressions! Please view some of my personally prompted work here.</p>
